can we have debug statements in our code as long as we disable them with a global?

replacing the name of a player if they quit and join again (if they are the first player in the session)

passing socket information from viewproxy to sessionmanager ok?
	intent -> use socket info as id for client

join will need playername and id for player (if playername is not id)
-------
join done separately

all other things done by pinging models specific to a session
	can the session manager be called before model
	or should something else be done?

passing the session manager in as a parameter to the view proxy
